A fairly well judged lesson, though nobody started doing proper work on their project.  All but a couple of the kids are now very confident at copying example code into notepad, loading it in the browser and playing with it.

The people who missed the javascript lesson last week thought this was the best lesson.

It turns out that one of the kids has been playing around at home and is now quite good at CSS3 transitions (I have not yet played with them - oops)
