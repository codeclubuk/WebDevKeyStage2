Announcement: YRS2012 - 1st week of August

h1. Revision and long practical

As this is (unexpectedly) the last lesson of the term we are going to deviate from the plan and do quick revision of all we have done so far then spend the rest of the lesson doing a long practical, with me wandering around helping out.

h2. HTML revision.  

HyperText Markup Language.  Content and structure.

@<title>@
@<h1>@ .. @<h6>@
@<p>@
@<i>@
@<b>@
@<em>@
@<strong>@
@<mark>@
@<article>@
@<section>@
@<header>@
@<footer>@
@<img src="http://www.st-marks.e-sussex.sch.uk/Images/St%20Marks%20Logo.gif" />@

h2. CSS Revision

Cascading Style Sheets.  Styling - appearance.

selector { property : value ; [property : value ;] }

h4. Properties

@color@
@background-color@

h4. Where you put your CSS 

* inline @<p style="color:red;">Hello World</p>@
* internal style sheets  @<style type="text/css">p{color:red;}</style>@
* external style sheets  @<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mycss.css">@

h2. Javascript Revision

@var myName = "John";@
Output: @document.write()@, @console.log()@, @alert()@, @confirm()@
Operators: @+*/-%@
Repetition: @for(i=0;i<5;i++) { }@
Comparison operators: @>@, @<@, @>=@, @<=@, @===@, @!==@
Branching: @if() { }@ [@else if() { }@] [@else { }@]

h2. Practical 

Use notepad - the network is too slow to use jsfiddle.net

h4.  Hackers

Using Javascript create a page on the fly that lists out the times tables from 1 to 12.  You can put the script in your html as follows:

@<html>@
@<body>@
@<script type="text/javascript">@
....your code goes here...
@</script>@
@</body>@
@</html>@

h4.  Designers

Design a Christmas greeting web page using HTML and CSS in an external syle sheet.  You can use @<marquee>@ if you like, and anything you can find at "w3schools.com/html":http://www.w3schools.com/html and "w3schools.com/css":http://www.w3schools.com/css
