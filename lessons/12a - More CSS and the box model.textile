h1. The last bit of CSS

There is just a tiny bit more CSS that we can use, but the lesson isn't essential (I skipped it the first time the course was delivered) which is why I have given it a weird number.

h2. Pseudo-classes

Have you noticed how links sometimes change their appearance when you put your mouse over them or when you have visited them? You can do this with the pseudo classes
@:link@ – an unvisited link
@:visited@ – a visited link
@:hover@ – an element when you mouse over it - can also be used with table rows to good effect
@:active@ – an element in clicked state

(if you specify styles for more than one state on an @<a>@ element they must be in the order above).

A pseudo-class goes at the end of the selector.  For instance @a:visited {color: red}@ will make visited links appear in red.

There are many other pseudo-classes, allowing you to apply a style to even rows in a table, the last bullet point in an unordered list etc.  You can find out about all of them at "w3schools":http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp

h4. Practical

Add a link to your favoutite website and style the link so that it appears with an orange background when you hover your mouse over it.

h2. The Box Model

<img src="https://github.com/mchapman/WebDevKeyStage2/raw/master/images/boxmodel.png" />
All “block” HTML elements – those which are not “inline” such as @<span>@ - have three “boxes” round them.  There are a slew of properties that relate to each which you can find at "w3schools":http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp - we are only going to cover the simplest now.

<table border="1">
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th></th>
   <th>Content</th>
   <th>Padding</th>
   <th>Border</th>
   <th>Margin</th>
  </tr>
 </thead>
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <th>Position</th>
   <td>Bullseye</td>
   <td>Inner box</td>
   <td>Middle box
   <td>Outer box
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <th>Colour</th>
   <td>Value of @color@ property</td>
   <td>Value of @background-color@ property</td>
   <td>Background (invisible with solid border): @background-color@<br />Foreground: set with @border-color@ property</td>
   <td>Transparent (@background-color@ of container element)</td>
  <tr>
  <tr>
   <th>Sizing</th>
   <td>@width@ and @height@ properties</td>
   <td>@padding@</td>
   <td>@border-width@</td>
   <td>@margin@</td>
 </tbody>
</table>

Sizes can be set in various units, but for now we will just use @px@ - pixels (a dot on the screen).  So to set the content size you could do @p.square-para {width:40px; height 40px}@.

h4. Practical

Add a 5 pixel wide blue border to all the paragraphs in your page.

h2. So how powerful is CSS?

There is a famous site on the internet called "CSS Zen Garden":http://csszengarden.com which contains an HTML file that is displayed with many different CSS files.  It has inspired a site showing what can be done with less than 1024 characters of CSS called "CSS1K":http://css1k.com.  Have a look at some examples, examine the CSS and see what selectors and properties you recognise.
