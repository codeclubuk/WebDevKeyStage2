h1. CSS 3

h4. Practical

Reload (or recreate) two notepad instances (HTML and CSS) and a browser (with the HTML document open), so that you can see all of them.  If you need to recreate the HTML the syntax for linking to the external stylesheet is:
@<link rel="stylesheet" href="lesson11.css" type="text/css">@

h2. Inheriting, Merging and Cascading

A browser builds up the property values for a selector as follows:
* Start with the browser built-in styling for the selector. If it is not defined for the selector then start with the styling for the selector that this selector inherits from (body is the lowest level).
* Process the style sheets in the order in which they appear in the head. If a new declaration matches your selector, merge it in. If it clashes with an existing declaration, override the old one (cascading).
* Process the inline style in the same manner.

h4. Practical

* In your external stylesheet set the background-color to black for the p selector
* Create an internal stylesheet (@<style type=”text/css”>...</style>@) that sets color to white for the p selector. Refresh the browser – you should see white text on a black background, as the properties have been merged.
* In your HTML file set up an inline style for a p element that sets the color to yellow. Refresh the browser – you should see yellow text on a black background, as it has ‘cascaded’ on top of the white.
* In your HTML file modify your inline style so that is sets the color to aqua (so the whole thing says @<p style="color:yellow; color:aqua">@ (which you would never want to do). Refresh the browser – you should see aqua text on a black background, as the aqua was the last value to be read, and it has ‘cascaded’ on top of the yellow.

You can see that a complex document, with many selectors and styling being introduced at many levels, could be very complicated.  A lot of the skill in CSS is in using as little as possible to achieve the effect you need – this makes it quicker to load and easier to understand if anyone needs to change it.  The developer tools in the browser are helpful in figuring out how a displayed style is arrived at.

h2. Backgrounds – styling with pictures

We have learnt about the HTML @<img>@ tag, which can be used to put a picture on the screen. Remember though that we want our HTML documents only to contain content, not style, so if we want a picture just for prettiness, then we don’t want it in our HTML. We would use the @<img>@ tag if the picture was part of the content of the document, such as a picture of a present on your wish list in the project, but if we just wanted a fancy background for our page we would use the background-image property.

h4. Practical

* Add the line @body { background-image : url(http://goo.gl/WqRGY) ; }@ to your stylesheet and refresh the browser
* Add the declaration @background-repeat : no-repeat@ and refresh again. Notice that the actual picture is very small and the browser “tiles” it by default.
* If you have time look at the backgrounds available from the web sites mentioned in "this":http://sixrevisions.com/graphics-design/20-useful-websites-for-graphic-design-textures-and-patterns/ blog post or at "subtle patterns":http://subtlepatterns.com/

h2. Class and ID

We learnt about the class and id HTML attributes but we have not yet seen what they are used for – now we will. You create a CSS selector for a class by prefixing the class name with a dot (.) which you will often see called ‘period’ in documentation as that is how americans say it. You create a selector for an ID by prefixing the ID name with a hash (#) which the americans sometimes call a pound sign (I have no idea why).

h4. Practical

* Add two more paragraphs to your document, one with class “bold” and one with id “italic”
* Add some CSS to make the paragraph with the bold class appear bold
* Add some CSS to make the paragraph with the id italic appear (yes, you guessed it) italic

h2. Pseudo-classes

Have you noticed how links sometimes change their appearance when you put your mouse over them or when you have visited them? You can do this with the pseudo classes
@:link@ – an unvisited link
@:visited@ – a visited link
@:hover@ – an element when you mouse over it - can also be used with table rows to good effect
@:active@ – an element in clicked state

(if you specify styles for more than one state on an @<a>@ element they must be in the order above).  

A pseudo-class goes at the end of the selector.  For instance @a:visited {color: red}@ will make visited links appear in red.

There are many other pseudo-classes, allowing you to apply a style to even rows in a table, the last bullet point in an unordered list etc.  You can find out about all of them at "w3schools":http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp

h4. Practical

Add a link to your favoutite website and style the link so that it appears with an orange background when you hover your mouse over it.

h2. The Box Model

<img src="https://github.com/mchapman/WebDevKeyStage2/raw/master/images/boxmodel.png" />
All “block” HTML elements – those which are not “inline” such as @<span>@ - have three “boxes” round them.  There are a slew of properties that relate to each which you can find at "w3schools":http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp - we are only going to cover the simplest now.

<table border="1">
 <thead> 
  <tr>
   <th></th>
   <th>Content</th>
   <th>Padding</th>
   <th>Border</th>
   <th>Margin</th>
  </tr>
 </thead>
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <th>Position</th>
   <td>Bullseye</td>
   <td>Inner box</td>
   <td>Middle box
   <td>Outer box
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <th>Colour</th>
   <td>Value of @color@ property</td>
   <td>Value of @background-color@ property</td>
   <td>Background (invisible with solid border): @background-color@<br />Foreground: set with @border-color@ property</td>
   <td>Transparent (@background-color@ of container element)</td>
  <tr>
  <tr>
   <th>Sizing</th>
   <td>@width@ and @height@ properties</td>
   <td>@padding@</td>
   <td>@border-width@</td>
   <td>@margin@</td>
 </tbody>
</table>

Sizes can be set in various units, but for now we will just use @px@ - pixels (a dot on the screen).  So to set the content size you could do @p.square-para {width:40px; height 40px}@.

h4. Practical

Add a 5 pixel wide blue border to all the paragraphs in your page.

h2. So how powerful is CSS?

There is a famous site on the internet called "CSS Zen Garden":http://csszengarden.com which contains an HTML file that is displayed with many different CSS files.  It has inspired a site showing what can be done with less than 1024 characters of CSS called "CSS1K":http://css1k.com.  Have a look at some examples, examine the CSS and see what selectors and properties you recognise.
