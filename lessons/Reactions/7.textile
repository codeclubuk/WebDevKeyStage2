My original plan was to revise the first CSS lesson for a few minutes and then go on to talk about Cascading and introduce manymore properties.  But the revision exercise, of setting up an external stylesheet tool most of the lesson to get donw with the 7 people who turned up.  Those who finished it relatively quickly seemed happy to add images and experiment with fonts and colors while I helped the others, so this lesson is now amended to concentrate just on external style sheets and the process of having two documents open (in notepad) saving them and refreshing the browser.  Short cut key strokes were new to them, so I did a little section on that and I had to explain about active applications.
