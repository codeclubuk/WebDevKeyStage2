Two major mistakes with this lesson, both of which are now corrected in the "lesson plan":https://github.com/mchapman/WebDevKeyStage2/blob/master/lessons/3.textile.

1.  Introducing color and background-color at the same time was a mistake.  It left a big chunk of quite dull stuff and I lost their attention.  Given that colour and pictures are what interest them (and buy their attention for a few minutes), I should have introduced background colour later on as a break from the dry stuff.
2.  It was too much.  By about 40% I think.  I underestimated the time it would take to spot and correct syntax errors 9 times.  Browsers are much less forgiving about CSS than HTML.  Javascript (next week) is doubtless going to be horrible.
