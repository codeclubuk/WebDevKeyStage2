h1. A big leg-up with CSS

Like jQuery makes using javascript in the browser so much easier, so "Twitter Bootstrap":http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/ simplifies CSS

h4. Practical

Look through the Twitter Bootstrap pages explaining grids etc

h4. Exercise

Add bootstrap to your project page by linking to an external stylesheet

@<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/assets/css/bootstrap.css">@

Then add classes to HTML elements as required to make your project look slick.

In particular:

* Use grid layout to give your page nice margins (top margin needs a bit of manual work in an internal stylesheet)
* Make the buttons beautiful
* Make the table beautiful and stripey


Take more than one lesson if required....
